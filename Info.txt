To run this Streamlit app that integrates speech recognition, translation, and text-to-speech functionality, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
You need to install the required Python libraries. These include:
- streamlit for the web app interface
- speechrecognition for speech-to-text functionality
- google-generativeai for interacting with Gemini (if using Google's Gemini API for translation)
- gtts for text-to-speech conversion
- numpy for numerical operations
- jiwer for calculating the Word Error Rate (WER)

Install these dependencies using pip by running the following command in your terminal:

bash
pip install streamlit SpeechRecognition google-generativeai gtts numpy jiwer


If you have any issues with google-generativeai, ensure you have the correct API key and proper setup for that library. If it's unavailable or broken, you may need to switch to another translation API like Google Translate, or modify the code for another service.

### Step 2: Save the Code
1. Open a text editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, or even a basic editor).
2. Copy and paste the provided code into the editor.
3. Save the file as app.py (or any other Python file name you prefer).

### Step 3: Run the Streamlit App
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved app.py.
3. Run the following command to start the Streamlit app:

bash
streamlit run app.py


### Step 4: Interact with the Application
After running the above command, you should see an output like:


Local URL:  http://localhost:8501
Network URL:  http://<your-ip>:8501


This means the Streamlit app is running locally on your computer, and you can interact with it by opening a web browser and going to http://localhost:8501.

### Step 5: Test the Features
1. Choose the input and target languages from the dropdown lists.
2. Click the "Start Recording" button to record your voice and see the real-time translation and text-to-speech output.
3. If you have a reference text for calculating the Word Error Rate (WER), you can input it into the text area for comparison.

### Troubleshooting
- *Missing Dependencies*: If any libraries are missing or errors occur during the install, ensure you have the correct versions and check for any system-specific dependencies.
- *Google API Issues*: Ensure that your google.generativeai API key is correctly set and the Gemini model is accessible.
- *Audio Permissions*: Make sure your microphone is properly set up and that your browser or terminal has the necessary permissions to access it.
